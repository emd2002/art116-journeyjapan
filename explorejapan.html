  <h4>Cultural Attractions</h4>
  <p1><strong>Buy tickets to popular activities in advance</strong></p1>
  <br />
  <p2>To avoid disappointment at Japan's most popular attractions, make sure to buy tickets in advance. The Robot Restaurant
  in Tokyo, Sumo Wrestling, Tokyo Disney, traditional tea ceremonies, and Studio Ghibli are all activities you should organize
  ahead of time. If you're going to travel via bullet train it's definitely cheaper to buy a JR Rail Pass in advance. However,
  know that the pass does not cover all kinds of bullet trains, and there are a few. Calculate the journeys you plan on taking
  and whether the cost of paying for the pass is worth it. If you're only visiting one or two cities, it may not be.</p2>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p1><strong>Know the cultural do's & don'ts</strong></p1>
  <br />
  <p2>Let's be real, no one wants to be that annoying tourist. Japan is welcoming, but has some unique etiquette rules that may
  surprise you. In general, Japanese people are incredibly polite, so return the favor! For an embarrassment-free journey here
  are some handy etiquette tips to arm yourself with before travelling to Japan:</p2>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid walking around whilst eating or smoking</li>
	<li>Know how to properly use chopsticks, but don't play with them</li>
