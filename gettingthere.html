  <h4>Before You Go</h4>
  <p1><strong>Check your visa requirements</strong></p1>
  <br />
  <p2>After booking your flights, getting your visa sorted to travel to Japan is priority one.
  Good news: most nationalities including the UK, Europe, Australia, NZ, Canada, USA, Scandinavia and Brazil will generally recieve
  a 90-day visa on arrival for free. But if you're travelling on a passport from China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, India, Russia
  or any of these countries, you will need to obtain a visa from your local embassy before travelling. Also ensure your passport has
  at least 6 months until it expires from the date you arrive in Japan.</p2>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p1><strong>Purchase travel insurance</strong></p1>
  <br />
  <p2>Before travelling to Japan make sure to buy a comprehensive travel insurance policy for the most priceless thing - peace of mind.
  As the saying goes, if you can't afford travel insurance, you can't afford to travel! The islands of Japan were created by volcanic
  activity, meaning earthquakes are not uncommon. Ensure your policy covers natural acts of fate so you can have a worry-free trip to Japan.</p2>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p1><strong>Pick your season</strong></p1>
  <br />
  <p2>When to visit Japan? The million-dollar question. Unlike tropical countries in Asia, Japan has four distinct Northern Hemisphere seasons,
  so choosing when to travel depends on what you're after. Eager to ski? It's winter for you. After cherry blossoms? Spring is your season, but
  know that the crowds can be insane and you will need to book your visit at least six months, preferably a year or more, in advance.
  Summer is the hottest season, but full of local festivals and fewer crowds. Finally, autumn brings beautiful foliage and cooler weather that
  makes long sightseeing days more comfortable. Weigh up the pros and cons of each season to decide what season suits your needs.</p2>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p1><strong>Decide how long to travel in Japan</strong></p1>
  <br />
  <p2>How long to travel around Japan varies from person to person. How much time can you spend away? How big is your budget?
  What do you want to see? If you only have a week to travel Japan, stick to visiting just a couple of cities. If you have a month
  or more you can aim to visit multiple regions and enjoy a slower, leisurely pace.</p2>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p1><strong>Have an itinerary in mind</strong></p1>
  <br />
  <p2>You don't want to land at the airport with no idea of what you're doing or where you're going! Organisation is key - have a
  list of what you want to see and do while in Japan so you can get straight to it. With the company of a knowledgable group leader
  and bunch of new friends to travel with, group tours are perfect for solo travelers, backpackers, and couples who want the full
  experience of a country without the stress of planning everything.</p2>

  <h4>Travel</h4>
  <p1><strong>Airlines and airports</strong></p1>
  <br />
  <p2>Nearly all major airlines and airports offer flights to Japan. The country's own two leading airlines,
  Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA), both serve a broad range of international destinations.</p2>
  <br />
  <p2>Japan's most important international airports are Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports, Osaka's Kansai Airport
  and Nagoya's Central Japan Airport. Japan's next largest international airports are Fukuoka Airport, Sapporo's New
  Chitose Airport and Naha Airport in Okinawa. Many other Japanese airports have a small number of international
  flights, mainly to Korea and China.</p2>

  <p1><strong>Packing tips</strong></p1>
  <br />
  <p2>We always recommend bringing a backpack on your adventures and packing light! Given the amount of trains you'll catch whilst
  travelling Japan, you can imagine that lugging a colossal suitcase around platforms would be a hassle. Below are our top tips on
  packing for Japan.</p2>
  <br />
  <p2>Make a list: List everything you need, then cull it. Why? Dragging around everything plus the kitchen sink gets old,
  especially when you don't use half of what you bring. Be ruthless in your selection! Things we recommend packing include:</p2>
  <ul>
    <li>Passport & flight tickets, of course</li>
    <li>Travel insurance documents & copies of important information</li>
    <li>Credit cards & some JPY cash</li>
    <li>Phone & charger</li>
    <li>Power adaptors for your electronics i.e. cameras, laptops</li>
    <li>Casual, layer-able clothes suitable for the season you're travelling Japan in - will it be winter coats or sandals?</li>
    <li>A 'nice' outfit for any nights you want to dress a lil' fancy</li>
    <li>Light rain jacket</li>
    <li>Warm jumper</li>
    <li>Comfy shoes to walk in - you'll find shoelaces to be something of an inconvenience due to the amount of times you're
	taking shoes off, so go for something you can slip into</li>
    <li>Sunglasses & sunscreen</li>
    <li>Toiletries & any medication you need</li>
    <li>A book or kindle to read - perfect for long train journeys</li>
    <li>Refillable water bottle and reusable cutlery to cut down on single use plastics</li>
  </ul>
